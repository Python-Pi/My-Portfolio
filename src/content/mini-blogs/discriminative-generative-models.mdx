## What is the core question a model need to answer?

Machine Learning models can be broadly grouped into two main categories based on the type of question they aim to answer:
- **Discriminative Models**: Give an input $x$, what is the most likely output $y$?
- **Generative Models**: How were the data $x$ and labels $y$ generated together?

The difference shapes how these models are trained and used in practice.


## Discriminative Models
Discriminative models directly model the conditional probability.
```math
p(y|x)
```
A common formulation is:
```math
p(y|x) = P(y | f(x, w))
```
where 
- $f(x, w)$ is a function (like a linear model, neural network etc.)
- $w$ are learnable parameters.

Discriminative models focus on only what matters for the prediction. They usually try to learn
- Decision boundaries between classes
- Direct mappings from inputs to outputs

> Think of a discriminative model as learning to draw the best possible boundary between classes

### Pros and Cons of Discriminative Models
**Pros:**
- Often achieve higher accuracy on classification tasks
- Fewer assumptions about data distribution

**Cons:**
- Rely on large amounts of labeled data
- Do not model the underlying data distribution
- Cannot generate new data samples

## Generative Models
Generative models aim to model/learn the joint probability distribution of inputs and outputs.
```math
p(x, y)
```

Using this, the model can derive the conditional probability using Bayes' theorem:
```math
p(y|x) = \frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)}
```

where $p(x, y)$ is the probability of $X=x$ and $Y=y$ happening together. Mathematically, it can be decomposed as:
```math
p(x, y) = p(y|x) \cdot p(x) = p(x|y) \cdot p(y)
```

Generative models attempt to model the data-generating process itself. They learn to capture the underlying distribution of the data.

### Pros and Cons of Generative Models
**Pros:**
- Works well with smaller amounts of labeled data
- Can generate new data samples
- Useful for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
- Can handle missing data better

**Cons:**
- Often more complex and computationally intensive
- May require strong assumptions about data distribution
- Sometimes less accurate for classification tasks compared to discriminative models

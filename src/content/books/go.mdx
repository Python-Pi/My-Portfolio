**Go** is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. 
It was designed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is a **compiled language**. The Go toolchain converts a source program and the things it
depends on into instructions in the native machine language of a computer.

# Tutorial

## Hello World 

Go is heavily influenced by C. Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Go:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main(){
  fmt.Println("Hello, World! 😊")
}
```

- "fmt" is a standard library package for formatted I/O.
- We can directly print any unicode characters like emojis/Chinese etc. in Go using *fmt.Println* function.

To run this code
```bash
go run helloworld.go
```

This will compile and run the program simultaneously. If you just want to compile the code, use

```bash
go build helloworld.go
./helloworld
```

*Disclaimer: This document contains purely my own thoughts and my own view of the
world. It's just a presentation of ideas but not an attempt to impose belief on others.
Readers are advised to go through it with an open mind, critically evaluate and
question everything and form their own conclusions based on logic and their prior
belief. Most of arguments I've presented here are correct to the best of my knowledge but of course I can be wrong*

I want to discuss one of the most sensitive topics regarding divinity aka **God**.
But before diving straight into the core of the topic and making conclusions. Let's start by
discussing how the concept of divinity emerged in human societies.

## ORIGIN OF THE CONCEPT OF DIVINITY

The idea of divinity is truly universal. Almost all the cultures across the entire planet
although different had some kind of belief about divinity. The idea of divinity has been
deeply embedded in human history, evolving alongside civilizations. Early humans, in
their quest to understand the world around them, attributed natural phenomena to
supernatural forces. Thunder, lightning, floods, and celestial movements were seen as
the actions of powerful, unseen beings. Over time, these beliefs transformed into
structured mythologies, eventually leading to organized religions.

I believe that some of the core reasons why humans started to believe in divinity are:
- The fear of things which can't be controlled.
- The fear of death. (Although this fear is a subset of the broader fear of the
unknown, it is so profound that it deserves its own discussion)
- The need for explanation and meaning of life.
- Psychological and emotional comfort.

### THE FEAR OF THINGS WHICH CAN'T BE CONTROLLED:

From the earliest days of human existence, people have been at the mercy of
unpredictable natural forces storms, earthquakes, diseases, and other disasters that
seemed to strike without warning. They have been at the mercy of pathogens which
caused unimaginable suffering due to unknown and untreatable diseases. Humans
inherently have the desire to know what (or who) is causing these pain and suffering.
So, ancient societies tried (to the best of their ability) to explain these using supernatural
forces/beings. The idea of supernatural beings controlling the forces of the nature gave
people a sense of order and predictability in an otherwise chaotic world. If a storm
destroyed a village, it was easier to believe (and cope) that a god was punishing them
rather than accept the randomness of nature.

> RANDOMNESS IN TRULY TERRIFYING (EVEN TODAY)

This belief in divine intervention gave people a sense of control through rituals,
sacrifices, and prayers, they hoped to appease these higher powers and prevent
misfortune.

### THE FEAR OF DEATH:

Death is the one certainty in life, yet its finality is deeply unsettling.

> DEATH IS NOT AN OPPOSITE OF LIFE, BUT A PART OF LIFE.

Many societies (almost all) couldn't bear the though that death might be a chaotic
event in a chaotic world. They deeply longed for a justification or a reason about
death. The idea of an afterlife, reincarnation, or spiritual continuation provides comfort
against the terrifying thought of complete nonexistence. There is not a single religion in
all of human history which doesn't deal or explain about death. Nearly every religion
throughout history has offered an explanation for what happens after death be it
heaven, hell, rebirth, or union with a divine entity. This belief serves not only as a coping
mechanism but also as a moral compass, reinforcing the idea that actions in this life
determine one's fate in the next or when met with the divine entity.

> Without a religious framework, many would struggle to find meaning in mortality,
leading to existential distress.

### THE NEED FOR EXPLANATION AND MEANING OF LIFE:

Humans have an innate curiosity and a need to understand the world around them.
They desperately want answers to the fundamental questions like: Where did we come
from? Why are we here? What is our purpose? The creation myths of various cultures
attempted to answer these existential questions.

Often these narratives placed humanity in central importance in the wider cosmic plan.
To simply put it, humans like to be special, treated special and fears being insignificant.
Since, we haven't found other intelligent species apart from ourselves, it reinforces the
idea that humans are truly special and important to the divine entity. All of the religions
discuss its teachings in which humans are considered as central and significant beings
apart from the divine entity.

The idea that humans are truly (by unimaginable order) insignificant in the universe is
truly terrifying. Even atheists share this fear about human insignificance in the universe.
In many ways, belief in divinity was an early form of philosophy, attempting to impose
meaning on an otherwise indifferent universe.

#### PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL COMFORT:

Religion often serves as a source of emotional resilience in times of hardship. The
degree to which religion helps to form emotional resilience is truly remarkable and
deserving of appreciation. The belief in a benevolent deity watching over people
provides comfort during personal struggles, tragedies, and uncertainties. Prayer, rituals,
and religious gatherings foster a sense of wider community, reducing feelings of
loneliness and despair. Faith in a higher power reassures believers that their suffering has
meaning or that justice will ultimately prevail, offering psychological relief in a world that
can often seem unfair.

> BUT THE WORLD IS UNFAIR

Many people struggle with the idea that life might be random and devoid of inherent
meaning. Religion offers a sense of purpose, suggesting that events unfold according to
a divine plan. The belief in fate or destiny helps individuals make sense of personal
hardships, reinforcing the idea that everything happens for a reason. This notion can be
deeply reassuring, even if it lacks empirical basis.

Studies have even confirmed that people who strongly believe in god on an average
tend to be happy and content with their life. This reason is significant enough that I think
it's good to believe in divine entity as long as they are okay (or doesn't bother) with the
idea that they might (it's purely just might) be believing in a false interpretation of the
world. (To be honest I can't say for sure that god doesn't exist, it's still a big question for
me)

## WHY WAS (AND IS) THE IDEA IN DIVINITY SO PREVALENT?

Human brains are wired to recognize patterns and seek agency in events, even when
none exists. This cognitive bias sometimes referred to as **agent detection** evolved as
a survival mechanism. Early humans who assumed that a rustling in the bushes was
caused by a predator were more likely to survive than those who ignored it. Over time,
this tendency led people to attribute natural events to unseen supernatural agents. This
bias, combined with **confirmation bias** (the tendency to seek out information that
supports existing beliefs), reinforced religious thinking across generations.
Religious beliefs are often passed down through generations, deeply ingrained in
cultural identity. Many people believe in a deity simply because they were raised in an
environment where faith was the norm. From childhood, individuals are exposed to
religious rituals, teachings, and traditions that shape their worldview. **The fear of social
alienation or even punishment for questioning religious dogma further discourages
skepticism and promotes continued belief in divinity.**

## IF NOT FOR GOD, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN…?

One of the biggest obstacles to questioning the existence of a divine entity stems from
the fundamental need for answers about human existence. From an early age, people
are confronted with deep existential questions questions that seem to have no easy or
satisfying answers. The following questions haunted humanity from and very long time
and continue to haunt even today, such as:

- What is life? How did it come into being?
- Isn't the world fair?
- Why does suffering exists in this world?
- What happens after death?

*I would try to provide some purely speculative answers which I believe in. (Although
they might be completely false, but I believe in them until I find suitable evidence that
contradict my prior beliefs)*

### WHAT IS LIFE? HOW DID IT COME INTO BEING?

The origins of life have always been one of the greatest mysteries for humanity. Before
scientific advancements in evolutionary biology, abiogenesis, and cosmology, the only
explanations available were religious ones. Many cultures developed creation myths,
attributing the existence of life to divine intervention.

Even today, despite overwhelming scientific evidence for evolution, many people
struggle with accepting a naturalistic origin of life that we simply evolved from other
species. The idea that humans are simply a result of a long chain of random mutations
and natural selection feels **unsettling**. It diminishes the notion of human **specialness**
and replaces it with a cold, indifferent process. For believers, accepting that life
emerged without divine intent makes existence seem meaningless an idea many
refuse to entertain.

Many people still argue about the notion of **life** and how it came in being? Although
there is no scientific answer to this unimaginable simple and hard question, Let me give
my thoughts about it.

Since, I am computer science student, let's start talking about transistors. Humans
developed them about 80y ago. Their functionality is extremely simple, they just have
two states, charged and discharged (No need to discuss entire properties). In essence,
transistors work by switching between these two states. If I somehow argue that when
you join a billion transistors, you can make an inanimate object talk, answer and act as
our assistant by doing and solving stuff on a post graduate level, anyone will simply
laugh. But now, about 50y after the early microprocessors, we have machines and
programs that can talk to us, explain about doubts, solve some of the most difficult
math problems. It would be extremely hard even for some of the most celebrated
visionaries in human history to think this would be possible during the early days of
microprocessors. Machines right now (in 2026) especially large language models are
exhibiting nascent consciousness (I shouldn't say consciousness but more like
understanding of the language and its significance).

Now, think of atoms and basic compounds. Most people can't accept the fact that
billions of this form a cell and billions of these cells together form humans, both the
human body and human consciousness. Even though most people accept that human
body is just an aggregate of what we consider inorganic dead matter in large
quantities, it's truly hard to imagine that human consciousness it an extremely polished
version of computer awareness. But most people tend to forget that humans didn't get
her overnight. It looks life on earth 4 billion years to evolve into what it is today. Most
people can't even comprehend the scale of this time, it's truly a very long time. All of
this idea that humans were mere mutations in a wider indifferent universe is extremely
unsettling.

Thus, belief in a god or higher power provides a psychologically comforting alternative.
It offers a structured narrative, claiming that life was purposefully created rather than
being an accident of nature. This belief in a divine origin is not necessarily based on
evidence, but on the emotional need for certainty in a universe that seems chaotic
and indifferent.

### ISN'T THE WORLD FAIR?

I believe humans (also many animals related to human bloodline like monkeys,
chimpanzees) are inherently ‘fair' creatures i.e. they have a tendency to exhibit fairness
(this is true even in case of some extremely abusive and exploitative boss, they just have
other intentions that overpower this inherent fairness). So, people are conditioned to
believe in fairness.

The idea that good is rewarded and evil is punished is a foundational concept in most
societies. However, reality often contradicts this expectation **bad things happen to
good people**, while corrupt and **immoral individuals thrive**.

To reconcile this contradiction, many turn to religious explanations:

- **Karma**: In many Eastern religions, people believe that moral actions influence
future lives or events.
- **Divine Justice**: Many monotheistic religions argue that if justice is not served in this
life, it will be administered in the afterlife.
- **Test of Faith**: Some believers argue that suffering is a test from God, meant to
strengthen one's devotion.

### WHY DOES SUFFERING EXIST IN THIS WORLD?

Let me tell you about Epicurean paradox, a question asked by Socrates to his disciple
Epicurus.

> "IS [GOD] WILLING TO PREVENT EVIL, BUT NOT ABLE? THEN IS HE
IMPOTENT. IS HE ABLE, BUT NOT WILLING? THEN IS HE
MALEVOLENT. IS HE BOTH ABLE AND WILLING? WHENCE THEN IS
EVIL?"

*Trivia: Socrates was eventually killed allegedly due to similar radical ideas and
questioning under the pretext that Socrates was spoiling the minds of the young with
evil thoughts.*

The logical argument is as follows:
- P1a. God exists.
- P1b. God is omnipotent, omni benevolent and omniscient.
- P1c. An omnipotent being has the power to prevent that evil from coming into
existence.
- P1d. An omni benevolent being would want to prevent all evils.
- P1e. An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into
existence and knows every way in which those evils could be prevented.
- P1f. A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence,
who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to
do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.
- P1. If there exists an omnipotent, omni benevolent and omniscient God, then no
evil exists.
- P2. Evil exists (logical contradiction).

Although it might seem like a stretch to make arguments like this about divinity. This
problem captures a subtle idea that if a divine entity were to create humans and take
care of them. Wouldn't the world be a far better place if he/she created a world in
which there was no evil nor suffering. The idea that a divine entity exists and events like
innocent children suffering, natural disasters killing thousands indiscriminately seems
extremely unsettling.

The standard religious responses (e.g., “God works in mysterious ways” or “It's part of a
greater plan”) are nothing more than evasions attempts to maintain belief in the face
of contradictory evidence.

*Disclaimer: It is completely possible that my view of the world is too limited but still...*

### WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEATH?

Perhaps the most powerful force driving religious belief is the **fear of death**. Humans are
unique in their awareness of mortality, and the idea of ceasing to exist is terrifying for
many if not everyone. Religion provides an answer one that is comforting (in a way
soothing) and easy to accept:

- **Afterlife**: Most religions promise some form of continued existence after death,
whether it be heaven, reincarnation, or spiritual transcendence.
- **Judgment**: Many religions introduce moral accountability, arguing that our
actions in life determine our fate in the next world.
- **Reunion with Loved Ones**: The hope of seeing deceased loved ones again
makes religious belief even more appealing.

By contrast, the secular perspective offers no such assurances. If there is no afterlife,
then death is **simply the end, a process to cease to exist** an idea that can feel
meaningless and unsettling. This existential dread drives many people to embrace
religious explanations, even if they lack evidence.

This is the reason why the idea of heaven and hell are so prevalent in many cultures
and religions. Eastern religions went a bit further to introduce reincarnation and
continual suffering to reinforce that idea that people who are immoral will sure be
suffering in the next life if not in this life. This also gives a sense of peace of that even
though if people suffer in this life, they can expect that their hardships and struggles are
rewarded with a happy and peaceful life in the next reincarnation.

This belief in cosmic justice discourages people from questioning the nature of divinity. If
one starts to doubt the fairness of the world, they may be forced to confront an
unsettling truth **that the universe does not operate on moral principles, and justice is
not guaranteed. **This realization is deeply uncomfortable, which is why many prefer to
hold on to the idea of divine justice, even when reality suggests otherwise.

*Note: However, the very fact that so many different religions offer contradictory
accounts of the afterlife raises an important question: If any one of them were true, why
do so many conflicting beliefs exist? The more likely explanation is that humans, driven
by their fear of nonexistence, invented these ideas to cope with mortality.*

## FINAL THOUGHTS

It's not hard to see that one side of the argument is extremely depressing and unsettling
and the other side is calm and comforting and it's easy to understand why one side
triumphed overwhelmingly over the other in terms of believers.

I've expressed pretty much everything I wanted to express. I hope this provides a
detailed and thoughtful exploration of my perspective on divinity, the origins of belief,
the existence of suffering, and the broader questions about life and existence.
Throughout this discussion, I have attempted to present a rational and critical view of
these deep and complex topics, unclouded by preconceived beliefs or cultural
conditioning.

Ultimately, **my aim is not to convince anyone to adopt my view**, but to encourage
others to think critically and independently about these issues. In a world where religious
and spiritual beliefs often shape societal norms and influence personal lives, it's crucial
to question the foundations upon which these beliefs are built.

*Final Note: Even I don't think what I've said is perfectly true since most of the things I
said can neither be proved nor disproved. I wish to someday know, how truly our world
works. May be death is only way to know.*

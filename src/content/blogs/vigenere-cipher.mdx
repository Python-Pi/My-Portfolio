## What is Vigenere Cipher?

Vigenere Cipher is a historical method of encrypting alphabetic text. 
It encrypts text by applying multiple Caesar ciphers (Shift cipher) instead of just one.

Think of it as:
> Caesar Cipher + Repeating Key 

Each letter in the key determines the shift for the corresponding letter in the plaintext.

> shift = position of key letter in alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)

Consider the plaintext: "ATTACKATDAWN" and key: "LEMON", the encrypted ciphertext would be "LXFOPVEFRNHR".

## How to break Vigenere Cipher?

Breaking Vigenere Cipher involves two crucial steps:
- Finding the key length
- Finding the key itself

### Finding the key length

We can use different approaches to find the key length, the two popular ones are:
- Using Kasiski Examination
- Using Index of Coincidence (IC) method 

#### Kasiski Examination

If there are repeated sequences of letters (typically of size 3 or more) in the ciphertext, they may have been encrypted 
using the same segment of the key. So, in this cases both the original plaintext segments and the corresponding key segments 
matches. 

Since we use a repeating key, the distance between these repeated sequences in the ciphertext is likely to be a multiple of the key length.
So, by finding the distances between these repeated sequences and calculating their greatest common divisor (GCD), we can estimate the key length.

#### Index of Coincidence (IC) method

Index of Coincidence (IC) is a statistical measure that helps to determine the likelihood of two randomly selected letters from the text being the same.

Consider $f_i$ as the frequency of the i-th letter in the text and N as the total number of letters in the text, the IC is calculated using the formula:

```math 
IC = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{25} f_i (f_i - 1)}{N (N - 1)}
```

- For English text, the IC is typically around 0.068.
- For random text, the IC is around 0.0385. (1/26)

To find the key length using IC:
- Assume a key length 'n'.
- Divide the ciphertext into 'n' different columns. Each columns is encrypted using the same Caesar cipher. (i.e. same letter) 
- So, technically we have 'n' different Caesar ciphers corresponding to each column.
- Caesar cipher doesn't change the frequency distribution of letters, so each column should have an IC close to that of English text (0.068).
- Calculate the average IC for all columns.
- Repeat steps 1-5 for different values of 'n' (key length).
- The value of 'n' that gives an average IC closest to 0.068 is likely the key length.

### Finding the key

Once we have the key length, we can find the key itself by treating each column as a separate Caesar cipher.
- For each column, perform frequency analysis to determine the letter frequencies, typically in English text 'E' is the most frequent letter.
- Assume the most frequent letter in the column corresponds to 'E' in plaintext. (we can try other letters too)
- Calculate the shift required to map the most frequent letter in the column to 'E'.
- This shift gives us the corresponding letter in the key.
- Repeat this for all columns to get the complete key.

Once we have the key, we can decrypt the ciphertext using the Vigenere decryption process.

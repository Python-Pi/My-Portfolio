## Possible root causes

Everyone knows that Indian cities are chaotic, and to some extent outright inlivable. 
But sometimes I wonder why that is the case. Is it due to just poverty? Overpopulation? Poor planning? etc. We can attribute 
it to many factors, but I just want to explore deep down the root causes of this chaos.

Here are the usual suspects:
- Poverty 
- Overpopulation
- Poor urban planning
- Corruption

### Poverty
Poverty is definitely a major factor contributing to the chaos in Indian cities. Historically, India never had 
the fiscal space to heavily invest in urban infrastructure (compared to China for example). Even today when India is in a much 
better fiscal and economic position, the government still struggles to allocate sufficient funds for urban development. This might 
be due to competing priorities like rural development, healthcare, education, etc. In simple words, politicans doesn't care about 
cities much because their electoral ROI is lower compared to other sectors. But I don't think this is the entire story. Many other similarly poor 
nations have managed to build relatively well-functioning cities. Take Sri Lanka, Vietnam, etc. for example. They might not have 
the best cities but they are definitely not as chaotic as Bengaluru. Just look at the comparison below between Bengaluru and Wuhan.

| City              |       GDP        | Population     | 
| ----------------- | ---------------: | ------------:  | 
| **Bengaluru**     |       $359.9B    |       ~13-15M   |  
| **Wuhan**         |      $296.35B    |       ~7.4M    | 

According to [some estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_GDP), the GDP of Bengaluru metro is larger than Wuhan 
but just look at the skyline and infrastructure of both cities. The difference will be even more apparent if you get to drive from end 
to end in Bengaluru. 


### Overpopulation
The usual scape goat for everything wrong in India. While overpopulation is definitely a factor, it's not the main
reason because many global cities have very high population densities but are still well-functioning. Take Tokyo, New York, etc. for example.
The chinese cities are another best example of high population density but well-functioning cities. Some Indian cities like Mumbai do have extremely 
high density but that density is concentrated in slums. But still the infrastructure in rest of Mumbai isn't that great either. To be honest, it's lot 
better than Bengaluru but still falls short of a financial capital of soon to be 3rd largest economy of the world. Here are some estimates found 
on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities) for Urban area.

| City              |       Population | Population Density     | 
| ----------------- | ---------------: | ------------:          | 
| **Bengaluru**     |       ~15M       |       ~10,982/km²      |  
| **Chengdu**       |       ~21M       |       ~10,821/km²      |

### Poor urban planning
This is definitely a major factor. Many Indian cities never had a proper urban planning framework in place. Even today,
Bengaluru doesn't even have a proper functioning Municipal Corportation (I guess it even doesn't have a mayor) let alone 
a proper zoning laws, building codes, etc. Even if they do have these zoning laws and other stuff, in many Indian cities, the local governments are ceremonial at best, they don't 
have proper authority to plan and execute urban development projects (It's not a CM's or PM's job to plan a city). 
**But again, poor urban planning is more of a symptom rather than the root cause. Why do we have poor urban planning in the first place?**




### Corruption
Another scapegoat. I believe that corruption in this world is an inherent friction for any country. It's not unique to India. Some countries have more, some have less.
But I don't think corruption is the main reason for everything wrong here. China is also very corrupt but still they have managed to build some of the best cities in the world.
I believe that if the underlying systems (laws, institutions) and incentives are strong enough, development will happen regardless of corruption.
According to [Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024),

| Country          | CPI Score         |       Rank        |
| ---------------- | ----------------: | ----------------: |
| **India**        |       38          |       96          |
| **China**        |       43          |       76          |
| **USA**          |       65          |       28          |
| **Russia**       |       22          |       154         |

Not good for sure, but not far off from China. 

## The Root Cause: Dysfunctional Institutions

India's development during the second half of the 20th century was bad, really bad not because of corruption but because the socialitic economic system which 
we believed in was fundamentaly broken. The 1991 liberalization reforms abolishing the license raj didn't fix the corruption in the country but 
the economic landscape changed drasticaly because of this one most significant reform.

The point I want to make is, the root causes of something severly wrong in a country are usually deep rooted in the underlying systems and institutions. This is clear 
in the case of economy, the poison for economy back then was the license raj, protectionism not corruption (even though it existed). I want to make a similar argument that the lack of proper functioning cities 
and the lack of Industrial base in India can be traced back to one of the most fundamental underlying systems in India: Land Rights system.

### Dysfunctional Land Rights System

India's land right system in simple words is a mess, broken and dysfunctional. In India, land ownership isn't conclusive, it's just presumptive. 
Even if you have clear documents regarding your land "ownership", the state just considers it as a presumption and not conclusive proof of ownership. In simple words, 
your documents in the perspective of the state imply "he/she might be the owner of this land" but not "he/she is the owner of this land". This is one of the original sin that 
never got resolved after independence. A colonial legacy that got carried forward. 

> In India, land ownership is primarily established through a registered sale deed. Other documents used to establish ownership include the record of rights (document with details of the property), property tax receipts, and survey documents.  However, these documents are not a government guaranteed title to the property, but only a record of the transfer of property.  During such transactions, the onus of checking past ownership records of a property is on the buyer.  Therefore, land ownership in India, as determined by such sale deeds, is presumptive in nature, and subject to challenge.

**"During such transactions, the onus of checking past ownership records of a property is on the buyer"** -- Is this a joke? Imagine trying to setup a factory.

#### What does this mean in practice?
Land accquistion would be a nightmare in India. If the government/private entity wants to acquire land for any purpose (infrastructure projects, factories, etc.),
it can get delayed for years due to legal disputes over land ownership. This creates uncertainty and risk for investors and developers. This is one of the main 
reasons why India has persisted with a weak industrial base. It's a structural problem. This is also one of the main reasons why Indian cities are chaotic. 
Without clear land rights, urban planning becomes extremely difficult and hence we stopped planning at all and let chaos take over. As a result, we have these big 
metropolitan cities that have no proper zoning laws, no proper infrastructure planning, etc. leading to traffic congestion, inadequate public services, and poor living conditions.

#### What did China do differently?
China on the other hand had a very different approach to land rights. After Mao took over, the Chinese government nationalized all land and established 
a system of collective ownnership(rural) and state ownership(urban). This allowed the government to plan for everything like cities, factories, infrastructure projects, etc. 
without worrying about legal disputes over land ownership. After the economic reforms in 1978, China introduced a system of land use rights, which allowed private investors to lease land from the government for a specified period of time.
When all this is combined along with the Chinese state getting richer due to economic growth, it created a virtuous cycle of development. That's why China was able to 
build massive, well-planned cities and a strong industrial base in a span of a generation.

I am not a fan of communism or autocracy, but I have to admit that in this particular case, 
China's approach to land rights was more effective in promoting economic development compared to India's dysfunctional system.

#### Problems India still faces 

India still faces many problems related to land rights. The land acquisition process is still slow and cumbersome, leading to delays in infrastructure projects.
Anyone can challenge land ownership in courts (which are already overburdened) leading to long legal battles. 
The lack of clear land titles also makes it difficult for farmers to use their land as collateral for loans, limiting their access
to credit and hindering agricultural development.

### What can be done?

Unfortunately, not much, atleast in the short term. Land reforms are highly politically sensitive and difficult to implement. 
Any attempts to reforms and rights will face strong resistance. Like every reform, this will also create winners and losers. This could create a 
political suicide situation for any government attempting to implement such reforms. But if India manages to implement these reforms, it would be a major boost 
for the business situation in India, it would remove one of the most cited obstacle for business in India i.e. land accquistion. It would also allow for businesses and government 
to plan for expansion in advance without a significant risk which is a key ingredient to have a lasting economic development.
